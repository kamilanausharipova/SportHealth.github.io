<p class="p2">People, are strong inside, but as a rule, do not realize it.in a man hides a truly great strength, it is the strength of his spirit. However, since childhood, our strength has been suppressed. And understandably, because it is very easy to control a repressed, morally weak person. The human psyche is organized in such a way that he initially feels his superiority over others. The behavior of children, direct confirmation of this. Children's psyche is sharpened on suppression, it is the same as that of animals, which are trying to get ahead of their brothers and sisters in the fight for mother's milk.


We don't know who we are or why we are here, we can only guess at it. But we can see that for our survival in this world, we have the most necessary qualities for it. But in our social environment, humility, obedience and fear have been embedded in us for generations, so that it is laid down at the genetic level. In this way, our inner strength has been suppressed for generations. The word "not allowed" is just for such people with a repressed psyche. Ancient rituals, shamanistic rituals, they were all aimed at training the psyche. The North American Indians were finally exterminated only when all the shamans were exterminated. It was shamans who made warriors invincible, they pumped their psyche so that they were not afraid of anything, and if a man is not afraid of anything, it is impossible to defeat him.

In sports, in business, in any kind of activity, you need strong character and fortitude everywhere. This is all, a person's mental state, which can be trained or suppressed. Manipulation of people, is the skillful application of knowledge of psychology for personal gain. Although I have repeatedly seen that all people can be manipulated, regardless of their mental state, people with a weak psyche are much more susceptible to it. You can find a key to any person, but a weak-willed person is just an open door. But a person with a pumped up psyche is an insurmountable wall. The character should be hardened, the psyche should be trained.

Of course there are some people who are fine with it, they are not repressed people, adapted to life. They are like untreated stone, nothing is impossible for them. Everything in this life is trainable, and the psyche is no exception. If you were humiliated, suppressed, oppressed in childhood - it's not a problem, believe me. You can become a strong person, you can change and move on from your past, if you just stop putting up with your weakness and start working on yourself. You can do it yourself or with the help of a good specialist.
