<p class="p2">Persistence and perseverance are very important and very strong personal qualities which help a person to achieve success and win. It can even be said that if you are persistent enough, it is already a great success for you and you can be rightly proud of it. But in most cases, many people are not persistent enough, they often give in to difficulties and thus deprive themselves of the opportunity to achieve more in their life, they give up, retreat and lose, instead of going all the way and winning. Therefore, persistence and perseverance must be developed, these qualities should be in every self-respecting person. This article, dear readers, will help you to do it. Read it to the end, and you will know how to become more persistent and tenacious, and therefore a stronger spirit and a person adapted to life, always ready to go to the end of the victory. And by becoming strong in spirit, you are sure to achieve great success in life.
So, first let's find out what perseverance is and what perseverance is. Persistence is a quality of personality, which is the ability of man to achieve a specific goal close, regardless of any obstacles and failures, it's faithfulness to his goal, no matter what. That is, when a person confronts setbacks that arise in the "here and now" of his life, he displays persistence. Persistent people are interference-resistant, they are able to show character in dealing with the tasks that are currently before them. For example, you need to do something important for you at the moment, or in the very near future. This case is not easy, it involves various difficulties and problems that you do not know how to solve. And so if you doubt that you generally should do this business, if you do not want because of the various difficulties associated with the case to bring it to completion, and perhaps do not dare to start doing it, then you lack persistence. But if you are a persistent person, then you will do this your business by all means, regardless of the problems and difficulties with which you will encounter in this case. And I draw your attention, dear readers, to the fact that being a persistent person and doing your business, you do not try to do it in one single way, in which you constantly fail, you must look for other options, in order to find the right one that will allow you to succeed in your business. It is very important not to confuse stubbornness with stubbornness, because stubbornness does not allow the person to be flexible in solving those or other problems, stubbornness forces the person to step on the same rake, while the persistence forces the person to seek opportunities to bypass this rake. Thus, the stubborn person exerts volitional effort and overcomes difficulties encountered, in order to realize an important for him specific close goal. Man makes one attempt after another, tries again and again, time after time to do what he needs, but it all happens in the mode of here and now.
Now let us turn our attention to persistence, and see what it is. Persistence is a quality of personality that allows a person to pursue distant, long-term goals for which it is necessary to make great effort and patience for setbacks. Persistence manifests itself in a person's ability to overcome life's obstacles over a long period of time. A persistent person without any doubt and hesitation goes to his intended goal and does not give it up because of the various difficulties and obstacles that may arise on his way. That is, in contrast to the persistence, persistence requires a person not a one-time, but a systematic manifestation of willpower, to implement the time-distant goal. For example, you want to get rich, and for this you need to perform - not one, not two, and not even ten tasks, but as many as it takes to achieve this goal. That is, you need to get a good education, you need to learn about how people become rich in general, you need to make as many attempts as it will take to succeed in this or that case that allows you to earn a lot of money, for example, in the same business. In other words, in order to achieve a distant goal, you have to accomplish many different tasks, while achieving close goals, for which, as mentioned above, you have to show persistence. Thus, it turns out that by showing persistence, to achieve close goals and at the expense of moving toward a distant, more significant goal, a person shows persistence.
Well, now that we know what perseverance is and what perseverance is, let's think about why we need these qualities and how we can benefit from them. We all have desires of some kind in life, we all want something and we all need something. In order to realize our desires and satisfy our needs, we must make certain efforts, must show willpower, make certain sacrifices, work hard to achieve something and get something, because nothing in this life is done by itself. Nothing good is done in it for us if we do not do well for ourselves. Without perseverance, without perseverance, it is difficult to succeed in this life, it is difficult to form a strong inflexible character, and it is absolutely impossible to be a winner, for these qualities are necessary to win. Our desires require persistence and perseverance, and life itself requires these qualities from us, because without them we cannot even feel ourselves to the fullest extent as human beings. We will not be able, hand on heart, to call ourselves human, the very person, whose possibilities are almost unlimited, if in life we are not persistent enough, if we do not bend at the first blow of the wind. Man is a strong creature, capable of achieving his goals under any circumstances. It is characteristic of man to swim against the current and to swim where he wants to swim. In addition, we must understand that life consists of a huge number of problems and mistakes, which we must constantly face. And if we don't learn to be persistent and persistent enough, we won't be able to handle even the small problems and we won't be able to come through the mistakes to the positive, desired result we want. And then we will never get full satisfaction from our life, for we will not achieve anything substantial in it. We must not give in to problems and must not be afraid of mistakes if we want to be happy, because you can't hide from problems and mistakes in this world. They are, as I said, part of our life. So it's not just for people with big, ambitious goals and objectives that qualities like perseverance and perseverance are necessary, we all need them, regardless of our outlook and plans for life.
And now that you and I have figured out why we need persistence and perseverance, we should ask ourselves the following very important question - how to develop these qualities, how to develop persistence and how to develop perseverance? This is a very serious question indeed. After all, it is one thing to agree that we need to develop these or those qualities in ourselves, and quite another to develop them. Sometimes, understanding and agreement alone is not enough, it also requires a burning desire, based on emotion, which will make a person do something that he or she must do. And in order to become a tenacious and persistent person, we will have to do a lot, because these qualities are not inherent in many people, so it is not so easy to develop them in ourselves. But you and I will certainly do that, we will show persistence and perseverance in order to develop perseverance and perseverance in ourselves. How's that for you?
Ask, how is it possible? How is it possible to develop certain qualities in yourself, with the help of these same qualities? It is impossible to develop something that you do not have. You can develop what you already have, and what you don't have must first be acquired and only then develop it. But that's the thing, friends, is that everyone has those qualities that we're talking about. And to develop them, you just have to awaken those qualities in yourself and then use them. We are all alive only because our ancestors showed enough persistence and tenacity for our own and ours to survive. These qualities are in our genes, we do not need to acquire them. But what we do need to do, let's find out below.
To become a stubborn and persistent person, a man of character, with patience and endurance, disciplined, goal-oriented and hardworking, you must determine why you need all these qualities. That is, you must turn your attention to your desires, needs and everything that you for one reason or another do not like in life, that gives you discomfort, that you want to fix. You have to experience the urgent need for the qualities you need in order to change something in this life, to get what you want and meet all your needs. You see, our brain doesn't like to work very much, and neither does our whole body, so we have to convince it that we really need to do what we are going to do, so that it will make us do what we need to do. The brain has a tendency to doubt the need to do something hard for our body and for it in particular, so it often asks itself the question - why should I do it? Why would we, you, need to be persistent about something? Why do you need to be persistent in achieving some goal that is important to you? Why do you need all of this? Explain to yourself the necessity of what you are going to do before you do it, to understand what and why you want to get away from, and what and why you want to come to. You need to understand what you will get if you are a persistent and persistent person, if you strain yourself, if you force yourself, if you control yourself.
Once you've defined your goal and answered the question - why do you want to achieve it, you'll need to figure out how to achieve it. And to do this you will need to develop a detailed plan for its implementation. It's important to be able to break down big goals into small goals, that is a long road to break down into small segments of the path that you can pass. If necessary, you can and think through each of your next steps, so as not to stray from the intended path and not to stop moving. Knowing the difference between persistence and perseverance, you should understand that for small goals you will need perseverance, but you will need perseverance to go all the way from beginning to end, allowing you to achieve your main, big goal. The most important thing is that you don't lose faith in the fact that you, like many other successful people, can and definitely will become a persistent and tenacious person in achieving any of your goals. It's important that you understand that you can, and I think you should, succeed in life. And not just live it as you can. If you can help yourself, fine, I'll just praise you and be happy for you. If you can't, that's okay, don't worry, ask me or other professionals you trust for help and become stronger with their help. You can develop any qualities in yourself, everyone can do it.
