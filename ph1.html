<p class="p2">Many cannot overcome laziness and take the first step toward physical activity.
Self-violence is bad, effort is good. It's important to separate effort and violence when it comes to overcoming laziness. "Fighting laziness is a dangerous story if it's violence against yourself," says the expert. For example, some people perceive sports as a mandatory part of an established person's life. They talk about it a lot and even write about it in books. But you should not take sport as the key to success. Otherwise you may feel inferior if you are not attracted to exercise.
Hope: It is important to realize what benefits a person will get from exercise. When trying to create the illusion of success you really have to force yourself, because there is an internal protest against conforming to something against your own desires.
It's a different story altogether - it's an effort on your part. Why don't you want to make an effort? More often than not, it's because a person doesn't see a prospect. In order to make an effort, one must "be in a resource," that is, get enough sleep, eat well, and feel comfortable in one's surroundings. In order to start exercising, to create a new pattern of behavior, it is necessary through effort to form a habit. A psychologist recommends a conditional system:
Notice your own resistance and ask yourself, "Do I really not feel like exercising or am I so tired at work and at home that the extra exertion will only create tension, not pleasure?"
Find the right sport. Everyone can find in physical activity pleasure for themselves. For some, it will be Nordic walking, while for others it will be tennis.
It is not necessary to be equal to others. When taking your first steps toward sports, it's important to consider your own desires and peculiarities.
 Many people "zombie" themselves to two liters of water a day and 10 thousand steps, and then, not drinking these liters and not walking these steps, begin to scold themselves. It's important to have your own system. It's the only way to gradually form a habit.  Everyone here will have a unique path.
