<p class="p2">Burnout is always a reaction to chronic stress, the most striking feature of which is the withdrawal (or avoidance) of activities that previously served as a source of pleasure. Withdrawal can be psychological, emotional, and physical, where the athlete actually begins to avoid training and competition.
Burnout is "branch" specific. In sports, it is defined as a three-component construct:
<br>
- Exhaustion (emotional and/or physical),
<br>
- diminished sense of achievement (diminished ambition to achieve high results)
<br>
- devaluation of achievements (reduction of the significance of the already achieved results).
<br>
The main reasons of "burnout" of sportsmen will be not trainings as such, but excessive prolongation of training and competitive activity, its monotony together with constant striving for victory, for personal records. The installation to run every start with a new "personal best" is often associated with constant dissatisfaction with oneself and anxiety about one's physical form. All this in the background, along with physical loads, puts pressure that with time can develop into chronic stress, the result of which is burnout.
Burnout passes through several phases:<br>
1. denial. For the first time the thought of stopping training comes, which immediately meets with internal resistance - the athlete manages to convince himself/herself to continue. Most often this phase goes unnoticed.
<br>2.Aggression. The athlete begins to be angry at himself, at the coach, the training conditions, becomes irascible, begins to confront. At the expense of the emotional outburst may increase tonus and subjectively it becomes easier to train.
<br>3.     Compromise. Fatigue and irritation accumulate. We start to talk to ourselves: "There are two more starts left, and then rest." Such entreaties help a little, but annoyance and anger appear, and tearfulness (more often in girls). Breaks between intervals, pauses in training become more frequent and longer, "energy conservation mode" is activated. The athlete begins to avoid contact with other people.
<br>4. apathy. Mental tone drops dramatically, and the athlete will wait for any excuse to stop working: discomfort in clothes or a forgotten water bottle will be enough reasons to finish the training.
<br>5.     Complete abandonment of training and sports activities.
how can you help yourself?
<br>(1) Action. Burnout puts us under stress, to which the body responds in known ways: "hit, run, or play dead." These are our evolutionary survival strategies, so it is only possible to end the cycle with physical action-another sport, an active journey, creativity, a release of emotion outward. Meditations and affirmations, when you convince yourself that "all is well," are powerless in this case: what is happening is NOT good.
<br>(2) Resource Recovery. And there is no contradiction here with the first point. Rest should be a priority. According to the latest science, 42% of your time should be spent resting[8]. That's how much time your body and brain need to recover. That's about ten hours a day, including time for sleep. This can also include socializing with loved ones, reading, going for a walk, or anything else that gives you pleasure. Keeping in mind that one of the causes of sports burnout is overwork, proper rest and recovery is one of the most important components of treatment. Take time out, no matter how scared you are about your lost form. No illusions here. Form will inevitably go away, but this is the one step back that will allow you to take two steps forward. Downtime in active training, however, does not mean you can quit watching yourself. Improper nutrition, weight gain or excessive weight loss will negatively affect self-esteem levels and contribute to burnout. To regain a healthy spirit, you need a healthy body.
<br>(3) Revise goals. Thinking about whether you are even doing what you are doing and whether the amount of energy expended is worth the output that comes from the activity you have named as the main one in your life is not worth it in a state of burnout. This very activity and you in it do not look the most presentable right now - everything causes negativity and "withdrawal syndrome", when you want to drop everything, forget about it and never come back. Determining the role of running (any other activity) in your life and clearly determining how much energy you are willing to spend on it is definitely important. Playing professional athletes when all other life is in shambles will lead to new psychological (and not only) problems. Now, however, I suggest that burnout can be triggered by the pursuit of one big goal, such as "life's most important" marathon or a full-distance Ironman, something that presses with its importance, responsibility, and exclusivity. We long and persistently move towards this goal, wanting to show the best result, we train as hard as we can, deny ourselves everything, and at some point we burn out. Decreasing the degree can help. Forget about the goal, devalue it. Realize that this marathon is just one of many that you will still have. Realize that you are already on your way and are moving in the right direction - forward. The big goals are just benchmarks. Let yourself blow off steam, break the monotony of the process. Run your next start without any expectations or performance goals, just go out there and show your best. Run a few competitions for fun: remember that you started doing the sport because it gave you joy (it is very useful to include at least a few of these competitions in your plan at the end of the competitive season).
<br>(4) Communication and social support. Athletes who participate in individual sports are more susceptible to burnout syndrome than those who participate in team sports, in which there is a division of responsibility for success or failure. Lack of this form of social support, particularly in runners, contributes to the development of mental tension and anxiety. Despite the fact that being in a depressed (burnt out) state, it becomes very difficult to maintain contact with people, it is still impossible to shut oneself off. Avoiding emotionally costly and unnecessary contacts will be correct from the point of view of resource recovery, but a heart-to-heart talk with a close friend, or even better, a conversation with someone who has nothing to do with running, can be very useful.

<br>(5) Self-regulation skills. Learn to vary the level of stress - to relax and mobilize yourself when necessary. Every sporting activity is accompanied by stress: it is not necessary to avoid it altogether, because a certain level of stress is necessary for an athlete to achieve success. How to determine what level of stress is acceptable to you? It depends on the peculiarities of the nervous system. Athletes with a weak nervous system are anxious, tend to plan activities and control their day in detail, and have lowered expectations. They often need help of a coach and a team. In the conditions of competitions they need to calm down, to lower the level of stress, to inspire self-confidence. Athletes with a strong type of nervous system, low anxiety, emotionally stable, impulsive, are characterized by a constantly high level of goals. Such athletes achieve high results in the presence of a very high (sometimes maximum) level of stress. They make decisions quickly, are notable for their independence and do not feel a constant need for a coach's help. In competition conditions, mobilization and stimulation techniques have the greatest effect on them.
<br>(6) Dealing with emotions. Controlling the pre-competition feeling of anxiety and tension, few people pay attention to their emotions after the start. Meanwhile, it is very important to work through how an athlete experiences failure or success in time (yes, winning can also be emotionally devastating). High levels of personal anxiety and a large discrepancy between self-esteem and the achieved result can cause the development of mental burnout. Stop demanding constant perfection from yourself and allow yourself to be both strong and weak.
<br>(7) Specialist assistance. In neglected cases, when we are talking about real depression or chronic burnout, all the aforementioned tips may be powerless. In such a situation, you should contact a psychotherapist, as a person may simply lack the resources to help himself or herself. Going to a doctor in this case should not be perceived as a whim, a sign of weak character or pampering: sometimes it is the only possible way out.
Run with pleasure and be healthy!
